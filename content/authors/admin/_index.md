# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an MD-PhD candidate in computational biology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Much of my current work is focused on developing bioinformatic pipelines to expand and guide personalized therapies in oncology. I really love developing software - and have begun re-structuring much of my PhD work as formal software packages so that it can be more easily re-produced, extended, and understood. My current clinical interest is in Oncology. Long-term, I hope to combine my interest in caring for patients suffering from cancer with my passion for discovery as a physician-scientist.
