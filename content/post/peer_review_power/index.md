## Submitting papers sucks - I used to think going through peer review sucked too 

I have published 3 or 4 papers in the past where I was responsible for navigating the morass of journal submissions, peer-review, asking collaborators for conflict of interest forms, approving proofs, the whole thing.
I often say that I love my work for the first 90\% of a project and then its miserable for the last 10\% (which ends up taking about 50\% of the time anyway).
For my previous projects, the process of moving a "finished project" through the peer review system was just another wall to barrel through.
I probably developed this attitude because of freakish good luck with my first couple of papers.
Wherever I submitted them, they were either summarily rejected or accepted with relatively minor revisions.
I remember walking into my PI's office back in boston, devastated to have received a decision of "major revisions" thinking this meant that we would have to do a ton more work on the project with no guarantee that it would be accepted.
She took a quick look at the decision letter and said something along the lines of "We can address all of this in the discussion".
Even the major revisions weren't so major.

A few years ago my luck ran out.
Around exam time during my second year of medical school, we submitted a paper entitled "Network Potential identifies therapeutic miRNA cocktails in Ewing Sarcoma".
As I struggled through two years in the peer review system - something incredible happened, the work got better - like a lot better.
In trying to placate reviewers and appeal to editors I accidentally validated the very existence of the peer review system.
After two years, three cycles of revisions (one at a journal that had initially rejected us anyway), the current paper, still entitled "Network potential identifies therapeutic miRNA cocktails in Ewing Sarcoma" is unrecognizable.
In this retrospective, I'll talk about all the dramatic improvements I begrudgingly made, and show how these improvements are reflected in the final product.

## Synposis of our work

In this work, we developed a novel computational framework for the identification of miRNA cocktails predicted to be effective in treating cancer. 
Our framework takes widely available RNA sequencing data as its input. 
In this study, we applied our pipeline to a dataset of six Ewing Sarcoma cell lines
