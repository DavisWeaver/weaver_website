Early career profesisonals are often taken advantage of. It doesn't matter if you are trying to go into medicine, law, engineering, or journalism. 
Early career profesisonals are expected to "pay their dues". We often work harder and are paid less than more senior persons. 
These working conditions are often justified using the same tired line about how part of our compensation is future opportunities for career advancement. 
Employers essentially admit that you are being underpaid and underappreciated now, but it will all pay off down the line. 
That arrangement may work in fields where you could conceivably work in the same company as you move from an early career phase to a mid-career phase and the company or insititution that "exploited you" begins to fairly compensate you for your past dedication (maybe finance? law if you make partner?). 
It does not work at all in fields where the institution selling you that line have little to no control over your future career advancement and importantly, won't be the ones actually paying you if you do make it.

After I graduated from college, I began to interview for gap-year research positions. 
Fresh off 26 rejections from medical school applications in 2016, I was looking explore research and beef up my application so that I could one day become a physician. 
With no understanding of my own self-worth (I had just been beated down and rejected after all) - I waded into the exploitative environment that is pre-med gap year labor. 
More than 50 \% of applicants to medical school are rejected each cycle, many of whom are qualified, driven, and passionate. 
As a result, there is a large pool of highly productive workers that research labs, scribing companies, and other medicine adjacent fields try to snap up. 
One of the most attractive features of the gap-year pre-med is that we'll work for cheap - like ridiculously cheap.
These institutions don't have to sell us a dream, we've already bought it! 
Most premeds in their gap year will work just about anywhere on anything if it means they might get into medical school at the end of it. 

Rather than competing to offer better wages or benefits, institutions competing for premed labor trip over themselves to demonstrate how they'll get you into medical school.
During one of my interviews at the job I eventually accepted, the interviewer said "With your application, and if you work for us for a few years, there is absolutely no reason why you won't get into Harvard Medical School" (I did not get into Harvard Medical School).
After 26 rejections and a year of desperate hope that I might get into medical school - I was ready to believe just about anyone who would say something like that. 
I accepted an offer the same afternoon to work for them on an hourly basis for about \$15 (current minimum wage in Mass is \$13.50). 
A year late, I received my performance evaluation: "10/10, no negative qualities, tons of positive qualities, does the work of someone with a master's degree rather than a bachelor's"
Armed with this clear endorsement, I went to my supervisor to ask for a raise, thinking it would be a relatively easy sell (it was not).

I don't even blame my old institute for the poor wages - apparently there is some hospital-wide payscale that requires folks in that position to get underpaid. 
These issues, such as they are, are clearly systemic. 

After getting accepted to medical school, I was exciting to continue working on research part-time. 
I held out hope that I would be able to pursue my passion for research without compromising on receiving a fair wage for the job. 
I (incorrectly) reasoned that as a candidate for an advanced degree with a demonstrated marketable skill for research, I would have more leverage to demand fair compensation. 
Unfortunately, when I brought up wages at the end of a meeting with prospective research mentors, I was practically laughed out the door. 
It turns out that at Case Western Reserve University school of medicine, there is an institution wide policy against providing any kind of compensation for medical students undergoing research outside of training grants that you have to write yourself. 
Why? because research training is "part of our curriculum". What a joke.


Look, I love research, I love that I get to work mostly on things that I decide to work on.
I love having the chance to take years to just sit around and try to discover something new about the universe.
Despite knowing how "unfair" the capitalist side of research training was I still decided to transfer from the MD program to the MD/PhD program. 
Its just that the longer that I spend as a trainee in biomedicine the more I notice people taking advantage of me and others in my position. 
  1. Despite working full time as a mostly independent researcher for the next 2-3 years, I still owe tuition to the University. While my PI pays probably 90-100k per year towards keeping me in the lab, I'll only see a \$15/hr stipend and crap benefits (I think the crap benefits part is specific to CWRU).
  2. Research trainees are rarely included as inventors on patent applications despite (usually) doing a majority of the actual work that is eventually patented - depriving trainees of a potential source of compensation that is available to other scientists.
  3. Trainees are encouraged or often required to assist their PI in writing R01s as part of their training - this admittedly valuable training exercise might bring in millions of dollars to the lab and 0 dollars to said trainee. 

The core philosphy behind all of this unfair treatment of trainees in research seems to be that while the wages aren't great you are at least paid in publications. 
Publications can lead you into medical school, get you into a better residency or a more competitive specialty. 
Publications can get you a good post-doc opportunity, or a faculty position, or attractive offers in the field.
This is an endlessly frustrating philosophy. 
First of all - the publications represent your good work. We did the science, we wrote the paper, we went throught he gross journal submission process. 
What other field pays you in your own good work? 
It would be like if junior investment bankers made pennies but hey its okay you are getting paid in successful mergers and aquisitions that you can put on your CV. 

Second of all, the specific supervisor that pays you in publications is never ever ever ever ever the one to be paying if you ever cash in on the fruits of those publications.
That may not seem like a problem - if you get into an ortho residency because of your publications then your earnings potential is sky-high and maybe working for nothing for a few years is worth it. 
However, if you don't get into that competitive specialty or you don't get a faculty position, the person paying you in publications still got the benefit of your cheap or free labor while you get jack shit! 

This idea that you are paid in future career opportunities puts all the risk on the individual and absolutely none on large institutions.
Damn. The more I write about this the angrier I get. We need a union.

**Author's note: If you are a future employer and reading this then haha just kidding I love capitalism this post is satire.**
